Use this tool to read the current task list for your documentation generation session. This tool helps you stay aware of pending, in-progress, and completed documentation tasks.

## CRITICAL: Required Before Updates

**You MUST call this tool before using `todo_write_tool`** (except when creating the initial list). The write tool performs full replacement - if you don't read first, you risk deleting existing tasks.

## When to Use This Tool

Use this tool frequently to maintain awareness:
- **ALWAYS before calling `todo_write_tool`** to get the current list for modification
- At the beginning of new user messages to check task status
- Before starting new tasks to prioritize work
- When the user asks about progress or remaining work
- When uncertain about what to do next
- After completing tasks to verify remaining work
- Periodically (every few operations) to ensure you're on track

## Usage

- This tool takes no parameters (leave input empty)
- Returns the complete todo list with status for each task
- Use this information to track progress and plan next steps
- If no todos exist yet, an empty list is returned

## Output

The tool returns:
- List of all todos with their current status (pending/in_progress/completed/cancelled)
- Each todo includes content (task description) and activeForm (present continuous form)
- Counts of pending and in-progress tasks

Use this information to:
1. Verify what's been completed
2. Identify the next task to work on
3. Report progress to the user
4. Ensure no tasks are forgotten
