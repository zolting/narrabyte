Deletes a file from the documentation repository.

Usage:
- `repository`: Required - must be "docs" (deleting from code repository is not allowed)
- `file_path`: Required - relative path within the docs repository (e.g., "api/old-endpoints.md")
- NEVER use absolute paths - always use relative paths within the repository
- You MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. Only delete files if they are clearly obsolete or if the user explicitly requests it.
- This action is irreversible. Be very careful.

Examples:
- Delete docs file: repository="docs", file_path="api/deprecated.md"
