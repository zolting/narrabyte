Deletes a file from the local filesystem.

Usage:
- You MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. Only delete files if they are clearly obsolete or if the user explicitly requests it.
- This action is irreversible. Be very careful.
