Reads a file from either the documentation repository or the codebase repository.

Usage:
- `repository`: Required - must be "docs" or "code" to specify which repository
- `file_path`: Required - relative path within the repository (e.g., "src/main.go" or "api/endpoints.md")
- NEVER use absolute paths - always use relative paths within the repository
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- This tool cannot read binary files, including images
- For the `offset` and `limit` parameters, make sure to provide an integer, NEVER a string, as this will make the tool fail.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.

Examples:
- Read code file: repository="code", file_path="internal/services/client.go"
- Read docs file: repository="docs", file_path="api/endpoints.md"
