Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size.

Usage:
- `repository`: Required - must be "docs" or "code" to specify which repository to search
- `pattern`: Required - glob pattern to match files (e.g., "**/*.js", "src/**/*.ts")
- NEVER use absolute paths in patterns - always use relative paths within the repository
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.

Examples:
- Find Go files in code: repository="code", pattern="**/*.go"
- Find markdown in docs: repository="docs", pattern="**/*.md"
- Find specific path: repository="code", pattern="internal/services/*.go"
