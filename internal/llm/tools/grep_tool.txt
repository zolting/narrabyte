Search file contents using a regex pattern within a directory. Pure Go implementation that scans files recursively. Supports optionally scoping the search and including only certain file patterns.

Usage:
- `pattern`: required regex to search for in contents
- `path`: optional directory to search; omit to use the configured project root (must remain within project)
- `include`: optional file glob to constrain search (e.g. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns up to 100 matches, grouped by file, sorted by most recently modified files first
- If no matches are found, the output indicates that explicitly
- Results include line numbers and the matching line text
