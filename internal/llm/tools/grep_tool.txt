Search file contents using a regex pattern within either the documentation or codebase repository.

Usage:
- `repository`: Required - must be "docs" or "code" to specify which repository to search
- `pattern`: Required - regex pattern to search for in file contents
- `path`: Optional - relative path within the repository to scope the search (e.g., "internal/services"). If omitted, searches the entire repository.
- NEVER use absolute paths - always use relative paths within the repository
- `include`: Optional - file glob to constrain search (e.g., "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns up to 100 matches, grouped by file, sorted by most recently modified files first
- If no matches are found, the output indicates that explicitly
- Results include line numbers and the matching line text

Examples:
- Search code for function: repository="code", pattern="func.*Service", path="internal"
- Search docs for keyword: repository="docs", pattern="API endpoint"
- Search with file filter: repository="code", pattern="TODO", include="*.go"
