Performs exact string replacements in files within the documentation repository.

Usage:
- `repository`: Required - must be "docs" (editing code repository is not allowed)
- `file_path`: Required - relative path within the docs repository (e.g., "api/endpoints.md")
- NEVER use absolute paths - always use relative paths within the repository
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldString or newString.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- If a file already exists, ALWAYS prefer using the edit tool.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not found in the file with an error "oldString not found in content".
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is found multiple times in the file with an error "oldString found multiple times and requires more code context to uniquely identify the intended match". Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replaceAll` to change every instance of `oldString`.
- Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

Examples:
- Edit docs file: repository="docs", file_path="api/readme.md", old_string="...", new_string="..."
