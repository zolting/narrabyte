Writes a file to the documentation repository.

Usage:
- `repository`: Required - must be "docs" (writing to code repository is not allowed)
- `file_path`: Required - relative path within the docs repository (e.g., "api/endpoints.md")
- NEVER use absolute paths - always use relative paths within the repository
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.

Examples:
- Write docs file: repository="docs", file_path="api/readme.md", content="..."
