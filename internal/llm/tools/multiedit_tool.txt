Performs multiple exact string replacements on a single file within the documentation repository in one operation. Built on top of the Edit tool, allowing multiple find-and-replace operations efficiently. Prefer this tool over the Edit tool when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.

Usage:
- `repository`: Required - must be "docs" (editing code repository is not allowed)
- `file_path`: Required - relative path within the docs repository (e.g., "api/endpoints.md")
- NEVER use absolute paths - always use relative paths within the repository
- `edits`: Array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:
   - `old_string`: The text to replace (must match exactly, including whitespace and indentation)
   - `new_string`: The replacement text
   - `replace_all`: Replace all occurrences of old_string (optional, defaults to false)

Before using this tool:
1. Use the Read tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct
3. You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing

IMPORTANT:
- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided
- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit
- If any edit fails, the operation stops at that point
- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single Edit tool
2. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations
3. When editing text from Read tool output, preserve exact indentation (tabs/spaces)

WARNING:
- The tool will fail if old_string doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)
- The tool will fail if old_string and new_string are the same
- Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure earlier edits don't affect text that later edits target

When making edits:
- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct content
- Do not leave the file in a broken state
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it
- Use replace_all for replacing/renaming strings across the file

Examples:
- Multiple edits: repository="docs", file_path="api/readme.md", edits=[{old_string="...", new_string="..."}, {old_string="...", new_string="..."}]

If you want to create a new file, use:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- First edit: empty old_string and the new file's contents as new_string
- Subsequent edits: normal edit operations on the created content
