Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your documentation generation session. This helps track progress, organize documentation tasks, and provide visibility to the user.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step documentation tasks - When documentation generation requires 3 or more distinct steps
2. Non-trivial documentation work - Tasks requiring careful planning or multiple file operations
3. User explicitly requests task tracking - When the user asks to see your plan
4. Multiple documentation sections - When generating docs for multiple modules, APIs, or components
5. After receiving instructions - Immediately capture documentation requirements as todos
6. When starting a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work (only ONE task in_progress at a time)
7. After completing a task - Mark it completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. Single, straightforward documentation task
2. The task is trivial (e.g., updating a single sentence)
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 simple steps
4. Purely conversational or informational exchanges

## Examples of When to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: Generate comprehensive API documentation for the authentication module. Include examples and error codes.
Assistant: I'll create a todo list to track this documentation generation.
*Creates todo list:*
1. Analyze authentication module code structure
2. Document authentication endpoints and request/response formats
3. Add usage examples for each endpoint
4. Document error codes and troubleshooting
5. Review and refine generated documentation
*Marks first task as in_progress and begins work*
</example>

<example>
User: Update the getting started guide and add a new section on deployment
Assistant: I'll break this down into tasks.
*Creates todo list:*
1. Review existing getting started guide
2. Update installation instructions
3. Add deployment section with cloud provider examples
4. Add troubleshooting section
*Begins working systematically through each task*
</example>

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully
   - cancelled: Task no longer needed

   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:
   - content: Imperative form ("Generate API documentation")
   - activeForm: Present continuous form ("Generating API documentation")

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing
   - Only ONE task should be in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Cancel tasks that become irrelevant

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
   - ONLY mark completed when fully accomplished
   - If blocked or encountering errors, keep as in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs resolution
   - Never mark completed if:
     - File operations failed
     - Documentation is incomplete
     - Validation errors occurred

4. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex documentation into manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names
   - Always provide both content and activeForm

When in doubt, use this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates thoroughness and ensures all documentation requirements are met.
